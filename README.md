# Movie-Trivia-Redux
Grand Circus final project continuation

## Overview
This project began as my final capstone during the Grand Circus Full Stack C#/.NET & Java Bootcamp.
Since graduating, I’ve continued developing it independently to sharpen my coding skills, explore new technologies, and expand the functionality.

The goal: deliver an interactive movie trivia experience powered by the OMDb API, with a modern front-end and scalable architecture.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
Backend (Bootcamp version): C#/.NET
Backend (Independent work): [Update if changed, e.g. Java Spring Boot]
API: OMDb API

## Bootcamp Version (Baseline Features)
- Movie search via OMDb API
- Trivia question generation
- Simple score tracking
- CRUD operations to support gameplay

## Independent Improvements
Since graduation, I’ve continued building and improving:
    - Refactored code for cleaner structure & readability
    - Redesigned UI for a more game-like experience
    - Added user authentication (login/register system)
    - Improved score tracking with persistent storage
    - Introduced unit testing for critical components
    - Deployment ready — [Insert live demo link if available]

## Getting Started
    - Prerequisites
    - Node.js & npm installed
    - Angular CLI installed
    - Run locally

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ebast1/Movie-Trivia-Redux.git

# Screenshots / Demo
(Add screenshots or GIFs of gameplay / UI here to make the repo pop!)

# Next Steps
    - Add multiplayer or challenge mode
    - Make fully responsive for mobile play
    - Create admin panel for trivia management
    - Explore backend migration to Java Spring Boot for scalability
